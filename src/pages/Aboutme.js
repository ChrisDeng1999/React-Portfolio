      <p>
        Hello, my name is Chris Deng. I am 22 years old and graduated from
        California State Polytechnic University, Pomona with a degree in
        Business Administration with an emphasis in Finance. I haven’t had any
        prior experience with software development but I hope to gain all the
        necessary tools in this bootcamp to have a successful career in this
        field.
      </p>
